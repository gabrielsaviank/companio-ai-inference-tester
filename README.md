## ML Classificator

## What is this? 

This is an application to test inference aka automatic classification of invoices using AI.
In Companio OÃœ we have an automatic invoice parser, that generate and preview invoices etc...  
I'm developing a tool to automatically categorise invoices in their categories according to the law.

This will help me test, train, and I'll see if my algorithm is 
correct and inferencing the invoices according to their categories 
and their taxes percentages.
